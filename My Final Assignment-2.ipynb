    "####       Kirkland is a city in western Washington with a population of about 93,000 according to 2019 census report. It is adjacent to Bellevue and Redmond, where many big companies such as Expedia, and Microsoft locate. And is about 20 minutes drive from Seattle downtown. Kirkland has beautiful waterfront areas, numerous parks,  and several art galleries. It has attracted more and more people to move in and live there. According to World Population Review, in the past decade, its population has grown by 88.47% and is continuing to grow at a current rate of 1.32% each year. Hence, there is a growing need for leisure, such as entertainment and dining."
